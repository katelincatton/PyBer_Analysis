# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Matplotlib
## Overview
The two datasets (city and ride date) have been merged into one dataset in order to conduct analysis on the information provided. The purpose of this analyis is to determine the count of rides by city type, count of drivers by city type, total amount of fares by city type. Addtionally, the purpose is to find hhe overall average fare per ride and driver by city tpe. With this information, we will be able to determine which city type is cheaper and which is more expesnive. Additionaly, the data will allow us to determine the fares by month, seperated by each city type, which will determine which time of the year that is cheaper to ride than others.

## Results
With this dataset, we were able to determine which city type had the largest count of rides. The rural area had 125 rides, Suburban had 625, and the Urban area had the most rides with 1,625 rides. When examing the total number of drivers by city type, we found that there was 78 drivers in the rural area, 490 in the suburban area, and 2,405 drivers in the urban area. It makes sense that the urban areas have both the largest number of rides and drivers because those have a direct correlation with eachother; the more rides, the more drivers needed. Addtionally, we found the total fares by city type: the rural area had a total of $4,327.93 in fares, suburban had $19,356.33 in fares, and the urban area with $39,854.38 in fares. However, when looking at the average fare per ride by city type, th rural area tends to be the highest, with an average of $34.62 per ride.
